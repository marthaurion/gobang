Go
=======

Learning C++ by using it to create a Go game. It should be easier than chess,
but I hope it will let me learn more about the language.

Things that are done:
- Abstraction of the board is basically done.
- The board is just a grid of colors. It also keeps track of the groups of connected pieces.

Things to be done:
- Create a GUI for the game.
- Don't allow a piece to be played that has no liberties.
- Need to allow for the case where placing a piece with no liberties will capture another piece.
- Add correct scoring for the game.
